<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I now have data on clipping volume from putting greens on nine golf
courses. For many of these courses there are data from multiple (or all)
greens at each mowing; for some of the courses there are data for a
selection of indicator greens, or for a single green. This report gives
a summary of the data collected so far, with some advice on how the data
can be understood and used, and with an explanation of what I’m trying
to learn from these data.</p>

</div>
<div id="volHistogram" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.1</span> What’s the use of clipping volume?</h2>
<p>In <em>Short Grammar of Greenkeeping</em> I wrote that a way to define
greenkeeping is to say it is “managing the growth rate of the grass to
create the desired playing surface for golf.” The typical way to assess
growth rate is to observe the grass, and also to observe the quantity of
clippings. Because clippings from putting greens are collected in mower
baskets, it is a simple procedure to measure the volume of clippings as
the mower baskets are emptied.</p>
<p>I can think of many ways that these data might be useful, but the volume
data need to be put into context, or have some baseline comparisons,
before one can be confident in changing maintenance practices based on
them. Here’s what I’m usually thinking of when I consider clipping
volume data:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/histDaily.png" alt="The median value for clipping volume is 1.2 L 100 m-2 and 50% of the measurements are from 0.67 to 2.2" />
<p class="caption">The median value for clipping volume is 1.2 L 100 m<sup>-2</sup> and 50% of the
measurements are from 0.67 to 2.2</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>growth rate tracking</dt>
<dd><p>One might have a target growth rate for certain seasons, for
cumulative amounts to match traffic, or target rates for
special events. Big tournaments might have lower growth rates. Busy
seasons of golfing traffic might require faster growth rates. One
can compare from course to course, or one can compare within the
same course from year to year or season to season. I have been using
units of liters (L) of clippings per 100 m<sup>2</sup> of green area. There
is plenty of variation, and that is normal. To pick the center of
the variation, I can describe the median values. When putting greens
are mown, the growth rate is such that 50% of the time <strong>the volume
is from 0.67 to 2.2, with a median of 1.2</strong>. That’s for all seasons
and doesn’t correct for number of days since the last mowing. That’s
just what is in the baskets, and the histogram in
Figure 1 shows what to expect. If you are getting
less than 0.67, then that is in the lower 25%. That’s not
much growth. And you might sometimes get from 2.2 up to about 10,
but that is rather high. This is not to say what any course <em>should</em>
be, but is an attempt to put this into context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>checking consistency or variability</dt>
<dd><p>Are all greens growing at the same rate? Are all the mowers cutting
the same amount of grass? Is anything changing across the course as
a whole, or on a subset of greens? Having a number for the amount of
leaves being cut off the greens helps to answer those questions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>adjusting inputs based on growth</dt>
<dd><p>It seems reasonable in the day to day operations of a golf course to
consider making adjustments in the N supply, mowing height,
topdressing rate, growth regulators, rolling frequency, irrigation
rate, etc., based on how much the grass is growing and how much the
actual growth rate deviates from the desired growth rate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>estimating the <em>real</em> growth</dt>
<dd><p>Volume is measured because it is easy. What can be even more useful
is the dry weight of the clippings harvested, but that is not
practical, for two reasons. First, one needs to separate any sand
collected in the clippings from the clippings themselves. Second,
one must dry the clippings in an oven. But one can make an estimate
of the dry weight from the clipping volume.</p>
</dd>
<dt>estimating nutrient use and harvest</dt>
<dd><p>Now we move on to topics that are of particular interest to me,
perhaps more from a research perspective rather than
turfgrass management. But if we have an estimate of the dry weight
harvest, then we can estimate nutrient removal through mowing on a
daily, weekly, monthly, and annual basis. If we know nutrient use,
then we should be able to match that with nutrient supply. We can
also compare locations. For example, if location X used this much N
and K and had a known growth rate, then location Y turf management
can be adjusted based on how location X was managed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>topdressing and organic matter management</dt>
<dd><p>Wouldn’t it be nice to never topdress? To never core aerify? If the
surface conditions were perfect, and then the growth rate was 0, one
would never have to topdress or aerify. I am interested not so much
in eliminating topdressing or aerifying, but in trying to understand
how this work can be done as little, or as infrequently,
as possible. It seems likely that knowing the growth rate, and then
comparing what is done at location X and Y, one can get closer to
the objective of doing that work as infrequently as possible.</p>
</dd>
<dt>checking temperature and growth potential</dt>
<dd><p>When I first started looking into this, it was largely on
this topic. I was less interested in the actual amount of growth,
and was more interested in how it was related to temperature or
temperature-based growth potential. See, for example, this report
from 2014:
<a href="http://www.seminar.asianturfgrass.com/20140612_clipping_yield.html" class="uri">http://www.seminar.asianturfgrass.com/20140612_clipping_yield.html</a>.
I’m less interested in that now – more about that later.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In some of these areas, I have a pretty good idea of what the numbers
mean. In others, I don’t, but I want to learn more and see if it is
possible to make use of the clipping volume data to get to an answer.
Here’s a summary of where I’m at so far.</p>
</div>
<div id="growth-rate-tracking" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.2</span> Growth rate tracking</h2>
<p>I really started to get interested in these clipping volume data while
working with Andrew McDaniel at Keya GC during the KBC Augusta
tournament. I’ve written about this here:
<a href="http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2015/09/tournament-week-clipping-volume.html" class="uri">http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2015/09/tournament-week-clipping-volume.html</a>.
To produce the desired putting surfaces for the tournament, it was
really helpful to check the clipping volume data. As I looked into this
more, I saw how easy it was to collect the data, and I realized that
there were a lot of uses for these data.</p>
<p>The second page of this report shows total amounts by month for
different grasses at different locations. From a look at that, you can
see what the normal amounts of clippings tend to be.
Figure 1 shows the clippings you can expect on a single
day. But of course that is bound to vary by season. I think it makes
sense to be familiar with the normal ranges and fluctuations at your
course, and also to know what is normal in the big picture of all
courses.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/boxMo.png" alt="This boxplot shows the monthly totals for all nine courses. If one divides the total volume in a month by the number of days in the month, the result is an estimate of how much the grass is growing on a per day basis." />
<p class="caption">This boxplot shows the monthly totals for all nine courses. If one
divides the total volume in a month by the number of days in the month,
the result is an estimate of how much the grass is growing on a per day
basis.</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 2 shows the cool-season and warm-season monthly
totals. Remember, this is for all months, so it includes some months
when the grass is only mown a few times. But it generally represents
what is typical over a long period of time.</p>
</div>
<div id="checking-consistency-or-variability" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.3</span> Checking consistency or variability</h2>
<p>This is something I am really interested in. I know some places just
test one green, and use that to track some data. I find in most
interesting when all the greens are measured, because one can then check
that all mowers are cutting the same, and can evaluate the
microenvironments on the course that may influence growth, and can check
the consistency of the measurements.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time working on this, and don’t have a perfect
answer yet. If you are really interested in this, please have a look at
<a href="http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/08/clipping-volume-variation-from-green-to-green.html" class="uri">http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/08/clipping-volume-variation-from-green-to-green.html</a>
and especially check the charts I showed in that post.</p>
<p>The best I can come up with now is this. When measuring all the greens
(or multiple greens), the median coeifficient of variation (CV) is about
0.33. The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation of all the
measurements, divided by the mean (average) of all the measurements.
That would be for a single day. If the CV is less than 0.33, you can
think of the greens as being more consistent than normal. If the CV is
more than 0.33, and as it moves above 0.4, then you can think the
clipping volume is less consistent than normal. The CV is not exactly
like going up or down by a fixed percentage, but I think it is
reasonable to look at it this way. If you measure say 18 greens, or 20
greens, or even 3 greens, and want to check the consistency, but don’t
have an easy way to calculate the CV, <strong>just take the average (mean) and
then go down 33% and up 33%. If all the clipping volumes are within
those boundaries, then the greens are more consistent than usual.</strong> If
one or more greens are outside those boundaries, then the greens are
less consistent than normal.</p>
<p>I’m still working on this, so if you have suggestions, I’ll be happy to
hear them. I prefer the coefficient of variation to describe the
variability in multiple numbers. I looked up the standard equation for
defining what is an <em>outlier</em>, and that is 1.5 times the distance from
the 25% quartile to the 75% quartile. 50% of the measurements will be in
that range, and one can take that range, multiply by 1.5, and then add
to the mean, and subtract from the mean, and then check if any
measurements are outside that range.</p>
<p>I prefer the CV to this outlier identification approach because I think
it more accurately represents what we would be looking at. Here’s a
quick example with green speed to illustrate this.</p>
<p>Let’s say we measure five greens with a stimpmeter. The greens have a
speed of 9, 9, 10, 11, and 11 feet. The average (mean) is 10 feet. The
standard deviation of those greens is 1 foot. That is, the average green
is 1 foot from the mean. The CV is then 0.1.</p>
<p>We could also have five greens with a speed of 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, and 11
feet. Now the standard deviation goes down, because two of greens move
closer to the mean which remains at 10. The standard devation of those
five greens is 0.79 feet, and the CV is lower than 0.1; it is now 0.079.
The CV tells us something here. It shows which set of data have less
variation from the average value.</p>
<p>If we would take the outlier identification approach, it doesn’t
identify any outliers.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.4</span> Ajusting inputs based on growth</h2>
<p>I don’t have any numbers to share here, but if I were managing turf, I’d
be adjusting inputs based on how much the grass was growing. I’d look at
the grass, and I’d look at the color of the grass, and I’d check the
weather forecast, and I’d consider the current grass conditions and how
those compare to what I want the future grass conditions to be. To those
data or observations, I’d add the clipping volume data, and take these
all together to make better choices about what to do and what to change.
How to adjust the dials of the inputs to get the desired turfgrass
conditions, as Chris Tritabaugh has explained to me.</p>

That is how much the grass grew, not counting water. How much actual
plant material was produced, per surface area of turf? While <em>volume</em> is
useless, it is easy, and from volume we can estimate the dry matter
yield.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.6</span> Fresh weight of clippings</h2>
<p>I think volume is the easiest thing to measure. To measure fresh weight
one must bring along a scale, or bring the clippings back to a scale.
And then there is the issue of the water in the clippings, and the sand
in the clippings. Sand is going to affect the volume too, but I think
sand will have proportionately more effect on the mass of the clippings.</p>
<p>Andrew McDaniel<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> has shared 2016 data with me of volume and fresh
weight measured from the same greens (Figure 3).</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The ratio of fresh weight to clipping volume for grass clippings

</div>
<p>This is for korai greens, and the ratio may be different for other
species. But for korai, as Figure 3 shows, when the ratio of
mass to volume is more than 0.5, that is when there is a lot of sand on
the greens. These data are being collected again in 2017 at Keya. In
2016, 16% of the mowing events had so much sand in the clippings that
the data had to be discarded, if we use that 0.5 ratio cutoff rule.</p>
<p>But after getting rid of the samples that are contaminated with sand,
there is a consistent relationship between fresh weight and volume
(Figure 4). To reiterate, <strong>I prefer to measure clipping
volume because volume is easier to measure, and because volume has less
of a problem with sand mass error.</strong> And after one has measured volume,
one can predict the mass anyway.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.7</span> Estimating nutrient use and harvest</h2>
<p>This is something I find really interesting. If we can estimate the dry
matter harvest from the clipping volume, then we can have an idea of how
many nutrients the grass is using. Mr. Kihara and Mr. Seiyama from
Nichino Ryokka carefully collected clippings and measured volume, fresh
weight, and dry weight at the Nichino Ryokka research center in Chiba.
Figure 5 shows the relationship between clipping volume
and clipping dry weight (there is a drying oven at the research center)
for three different grasses.</p>

</div>
<p>If we focus on creeping bentgrass and <em>Zoysia matrella</em> (korai), I’ll
quickly explain how this works. First, let’s do bentgrass. The slope of
the line (in Figure 5) for the bentgrass volume to dry
weight relationship is 0.63 g m<sup>-2</sup> for every 1 L 100 m<sup>-2</sup>. The
bentgrass greens at the location 36 degrees North latitude have an
average annual yield in volume of 326 L 100 m<sup>-2</sup>. That works out to an
expected annual clipping harvest of 205 g m<sup>-2</sup>. If the bentgrass leaves
have 4% N, that is 8.2 g N m<sup>-2</sup>. The N applied to those greens in 2014
was 12.9 g, then 10.1 in 2015, and I don’t have the final numbers for
2016 but it was less than 10. So there seems to be a pretty close
correspondence between the N applied and the growth.</p>
<p>For korai, I’ll use the data from the zoysia at 33 degrees North. The
average clipping volume from 2013 to 2016 at this location was 340 L 100
m<sup>-2</sup>. From the Nichino Ryokka data, we can expect each liter of korai
clippings in 100 m<sup>2</sup> to work out to 1.1 g of dried clippings in 1 m<sup>2</sup>.
That gives an expected harvest of 374 g m<sup>-2</sup>, and if the korai
clippings have 3% N, that would be a N harvest in the clippings of 11.2
g m<sup>-2</sup>. At this location, the N applied from 2013 to 2016 was 14.6,
9.5, 10.6, and 11.1 g m<sup>-2</sup>. We can work through this for every element.
I just show for N to point out that in the case of profesionally-managed
turf (both the bentgrass and korai course used as examples here host
professional tournaments too) supplied with a relatively low amount of N
fertilizer, the quantity of clippings produced is related to the
quantity of N supplied.</p>
<p><strong>The implications of this are that one can be more precise in nutrient
applications.</strong> And I am interested in this as a way to check nutrient
depletion rates from the soil, and do some calculations related to the
<span class="smallcaps">MLSN</span> guidelines. I think
for most turfgrass managers, it is enough to understand that the
clipping harvest represents a quantity of nutrients, and also the
fertilizer applied represents a quantity of nutrients. This particular
aspect is more of a research thing, rather than a turf management thing,
but I am especially interested in this.</p>
<p>You can imagine what I think of supplying two or three or more times the
quantity of an element, like potassium or phosphorus or calcium,
compared to the amount that is used by the grass. These calculation are
a way to document this.</p>

<div id="topdressing-and-organic-matter-management" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.8</span> Topdressing and organic matter management</h2>
<p>But this growth, as it relates to the nitrogen supply, is quite
pertinent to this section. I don’t have too much to say here, other than
it makes sense to me that if the grass grows less, by less N supply,
then there will be less of a need for topdressing and core aeration.</p>
<p>If you haven’t, see
<a href="http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/05/data-to-support-an-anecdote.html" class="uri">http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/05/data-to-support-an-anecdote.html</a>
for more about this. This is about a course doing 45,000 rounds per year
and that has dormant grass for 6 months. The N supply is low, the grass
conditions have gotten better year after year, and the soil organic
matter keeps going down. But the core aeration and topdressing are also
less than what you might expect.</p>
<p>I believe this approach can be implemented in more places. And I think
measuring clipping volume can be a way to compare locations. So if X
location is having great success with this much topdressing and this
much N and this much clipping volume, I think the clipping volume
comparison from place to place can be used to fine tune some of the
organic matter management. I’ve written articles about this in my series
for <em>Golf Course Seminar</em> magazine, in particular I think the March and
April 2017 issues. When I get the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of <em>Short Grammar of
Greenkeeping</em> to the printer, those articles (in English) will be
included as appendices.</p>

<div id="checking-temperature-and-growth-potential" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">B.9</span> Checking temperature and growth potential</h2>
<p>This was my original interest in this, and I am still working to
understand this. There is obviously a relationship – look for example at
seashore paspalum at 21 degrees North – it grows less in winter. Look at
fine fescue mix at 64 degrees North – it doesn’t grow in winter. At the
broad scale, temperature plays a huge role. Actually, looking at all the
charts again, it is easy to see how much of a seasonal – a temperature –
effect is there.</p>
<p>As I’ve become interested in predicting dry weight of clippings and
nutrient use of grass, and also trying to understand what normal
variability of growth is, I put the temperature analysis on the back
burner. I’m still really interested in this, but there is only so much
time to work on it!</p>
